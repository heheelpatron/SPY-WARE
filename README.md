**SPYWARE**

**REVERSE SHELL EXECUTION**

A reverse shell will be executed on a machine within the same network, and from there we run a script to capture screenshots of that machine and save them in a folder.

Using NETCAT the attacker connects to the victim's machine.

When I connect to the device I create a script that steals information.

And if everything worked perfectly this process is used to spy on a machine and steal its information.

Very exciting project, If you want to see how this went click in the link below.
